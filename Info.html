        <h1>EcoLibria</h1>
        <p>
            Our team has created a game in which we invite the user to think about what are the components of a
            sustainable community.
            Additionally, we hope to inspire our audience to think about how they can localize the place where they
            actually live,
            work, shop, or play.
        </p>

        <h2>Game Play</h2>
        <p>
            As the player you can design your community in any way you see fit.
            You will hopefully design your communities in a way such that your citizens can easily move from
            their homes to work, school, and store.
            As a result, your community will need to drive less and emit fewer greenhouse gases.
        </p>

        <h2>Controls</h2>
        <p>
            To select a comunity that you want to interact with, tap anywhere within that community to zoom into
            it.<br /><br />

            To select the infrastructure you want to place in the community, select one the blue tiles.
            Then, place it on one of the empty tiles (The cost of each tile is indicated in the section
            below)<br /><br />

            To browse through each community while zoomed in, tap on the right arrow button, located to the right of the
            selection tiles <br /><br />

            To zoom out of the current community, tap on the magnifying glass, located to the left of the selection

        <h2>Money</h2>
        In EcoLibria, every new game will start with $2000. There are two ways to gain money.
        
        <h3>Removing Tiles</h3>
        <div>
            <b style="color: red">Money gained for removing a tile: $(50% of initial cost)</b><br/><br/>
            You are allowed to remove <b>any of the 5 tiles above</b> and get 50% of the placement cost</br>
            <b>For example:</b> Removing an office tile will give you $500 <br/><br/>

            <b>HOWEVER,</b> CO2 ppm will increase by the following values:<br/><br/>
            <b>25ppm / deleted Park tile</b><br/><br/>
            <b>30ppm / deleted House tile</b><br/><br/>
            <b>33ppm / deleted Store tile</b><br/><br/>
            <b>45ppm / deleted Hospital tile</b><br/><br/>
            <b>75ppm / deleted Office tile</b><br/><br/>
        </div>

        <h3>Passive Income</h3>
        <div>
            <b style="color: red">Money gained per second: $25 x (# of office tiles associated with a house tile)</b><br/><br/>
            To gain passive income, at least one office tile must be present on the map, along with an associated house.<br/>
            <b>For example:</b> if you have 1 house and 2 office tiles on the map, you will only receive the benefit of one office because there is only 1 house.
            That is, you will receive <b>$25/second</b> <br/><br/>
