            <h1>Our team</h1>
            <p>
                Our team joined together because we had an assignment to fulfill.
                However, after painful deliberation, we may have come up with a good
                idea for a game. Attempting to fulfill that idea had been an impossible
                task, but we had a lot fun trying.

            <h2>Story of our App</h2>
            <p>
                Despite the abundance environmentally themed games in the market, very few of them are both fun and
                engaging.
                Among that number, only a handful of them are meant to serve as a means to educate the player about the
                various environmental issues.
                Thus, we wanted to create an environmentally themed game that is realistic, fun, challenging, and
                somewhat educational. <br /><br />
                And that's how <b>EcoLibria</b> was born.

                Although I knew of Global Warming and how rising CO2 levels affected the earth,
                I never really stopped to consider just what impacts it could have on humans until I remembered being
                stuck in a traffic jam and watching the exhaust fumes rise up into the sky,
                thinking that there should be a better way to design a city so that people don't have to burn so much
                fuel needlessly.
                That's why in EcoLibria, the major goal of the game is to create a city that minimizes the amount of CO2
                emissions produced

                    Michael is currently a full-time student at BCIT.
                    During this project, he mostly worked with the <a href="https://phaser.io/phaser3">Phaser 3</a> game
                    framework.
                    During his freetime, Michael likes to spend time on programming-related side projects as well as
                    playing video games and piano.<br><br>

                    I am detail-orientated and wish harm on no man or woman or person.
                    I struggle with complexity and think we may be living on the cusp of a techno-dystopia? Or eutopia.
                    It
                    depends on your criteria.
                    I like machines; their fastidiousness to detail and their logical construction.
                    I like human beings; their ubiquity in the global biome and their prolific, yet relatively untapped
                    potential for creative thought.
                    I am wary of prognosticators and experts, in all fields.
                    I think human language is one of nature’s most beautiful creations.
                    And I want everyone to get along while still having a good time.
