# About
EcoLibria is a web-based game in which the player assumes responsibility for the creation and maintenance of an ecologically sustainable community. The player’s primary objective is to reduce carbon emissions produced by traffic, industry, demolition, and creation of city infrastructure; carbon sinks, such as urban landscapes and parks, are also a component of game play.  
  
Although presenting a simplified model of an urban ecosystem, EcoLibria provides the player with the ‘big picture’ of how transport options, the proximity of employment, and other essential aspects of urban development are integrated, and how they can be made more efficient. While immersed, the player gains an understanding of the challenges and complexities of reducing green house gases and carbon emissions.
